# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
<h3>This is a Natural Language Processing and Classification problem. This also includes the basic preprocessing steps for text data, EDA, feature extraction, training and testing and in this we get classifications of whether a specific comment or hashtag is negative or positive .
Negative comments mainly includes racist or sexist comment or the hashtags and the once that doesn't contains this are said to be positive once</h3>

<h5>For model training I have used Logistic Regression and the evaluation metric used is f1_score and accuracy_score</h5>
